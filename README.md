# Facility Manager Guides
Welcome to the GitHub Repo for accessing facility manager guides and manuals. All of the information and links to guides can be found on the home page of the [Wiki](https://github.com/tkdkel/Facility-Manager-Guides/wiki) 

## Brief Summary
This domain setup is part of a capstone project done by myself and Mark Headley. The point was to join all of the facility computers under one "roof" so that everything could be managed in a more streamlined way. It also helps address the security issues around people leaving accounts logged in and downloading things without needing an admin password. 

## Contact
Since this is a capstone project, there will likely be some issues that pop up. If you find any errors, have a question, or have suggestions, please reach out to either me or Mark via Discord.
